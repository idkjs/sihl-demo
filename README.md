# Sihl Demo Application

This is a simple demo application showcasing the web framework [Sihl](https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl). This project is meant to be clicked through to give a general sense of the folder and file structure of a typical Sihl project. This project aims to cover all aspects of Sihl comprehensively. It can also be used as a starter to kindle your own Sihl project!

## Installation
If you want to run this demo application locally, you will need `dune` and `opam`.

1. Clone the repository and run
   ```
   dune build
   ```
